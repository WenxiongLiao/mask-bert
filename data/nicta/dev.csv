One hundred thirty-four patients suspected of having pancreas cancer successfully underwent gray scale ultrasound examination of the pancreas .	4
The prospective ultrasound findings were correlated with the final diagnoses , laparotomy findings , and pathology findings .	2
Fifty-four patients had pancreas cancer , confirmed by resection or biopsy in all cases .	2
On ultrasonography , the pancreas was correctly reported to have abnormalities in sixty-one of seventy-eight patients ( 78 per cent ) and correctly reported to have no abnornalities in thirty-eight of fifty-six patients ( 68 per cent ) .	2
A correct ultrasound diagnosis of pancreas cancer was made for forty-four of fifty-six patients ( 81 per cent ) , and there were thirteen false-positive reports .	2
Ninety-four percent of cancers confined to the head of the pancreas and 70 per cent of cancers at other locations within the gland were detected by ultrasound examination .	2
The correct ultrasound diagnosis was given for fifteen of seventeen patients with resectable pancreas cancer , the degree of associated pancreatitis ranging from minimal to severe .	2
Analysis of the predictive values of positive and negative ultrasound examinations suggests that this test could be used to screen a population of patients with symptoms mildly suggestive of pancreas cancer .	2
The importance of preselecting the level of confidence of a positive test result , a , ove which further investigation is indicated , is emphasized .	2
In this secondary data analysis of Primary Care Research in Substance Abuse and Mental Health for the Elderly ( PRIMSe ) study , we hypothesized that older minorities who receive mental health services integrated in primary care settings would have greater s	0
We identified 2,022 ( 48 % minorities ) primary care patients 65 years and older , who met study inclusion criteria and had either alcohol misuse , depression , and/or anxiety .	4
They were randomized to receive treatment for these disorders in the primary care clinic or to a brokerage case management model that linked patients to community-based services .	3
Service use and clinical outcomes were collected at baseline , three months and six months post randomization on all participants .	1
Access to and participation in mental health / substance abuse services was greater in the integrated model than in referral ; there were no treatment by ethnicity effects .	2
There were no treatment effects for any of the clinical outcomes ; Whites and older minorities in both integrated and referral groups failed to show clinically significant improvement in symptoms and physical functioning at 6 months .	2
While providing services in primary care results in better access to and use of these services , accessing these services is not enough for assuring adequate clinical outcomes .	2
This report describes the case mix and outcome ( mortality , intensive care unit ( ICU ) and hospital length of stay ) for admissions to ICU for head injury and evaluates the predictive ability of five risk adjustment models .	0
A secondary analysis was conducted of data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre ( ICNARC ) Case Mix Programme , a high quality clinical database , of 374,594 admissions to 171 adult critical care units across England , Wales and Northern	4
The discrimination and calibration of five risk prediction models , SAPS II , MPM II , APACHE II and III and the ICNARC model plus raw Glasgow Coma Score ( GCS ) were compared .	1
There were 11,021 admissions following traumatic brain injury identified ( 3 % of all database admissions ) .	2
Mortality in ICU was 23.5 % and in-hospital was 33.5 % .	2
Median ICU and hospital lengths of stay were 3.2 and 24 days , respectively , for survivors and 1.6 and 3 days , respectively , for non-survivors .	2
The ICNARC model , SAPS II and MPM II discriminated best between survivors and non-survivors and were better calibrated than raw GCS , APACHE II and III in 5,393 patients eligible for all models .	2
Traumatic brain injury requiring intensive care has a high mortality rate .	2
Non-survivors have a short length of ICU and hospital stay .	2
APACHE II and III have poorer calibration and discrimination than SAPS II , MPM II and the ICNARC model in traumatic brain injury ; however , no model had perfect calibration .	2
Patients with multiple sclerosis who develop progressive disability from onset without relapses or remissions pose difficulties in diagnosis , monitoring of disease activity and treatment .	0
There is a need to define the diagnostic criteria for this group more precisely and , in particular , to describe a comprehensive battery of investigations to exclude other conditions .	0
The mechanisms underlying the development of disability and the role of MRI in monitoring disease activity in this clinical subgroup require elucidation , particularly in view of the lack of change on conventional imaging in the presence of continuing clin	0
The prognosis is poor and there are currently no treatment trials for this form of the disease .	0
Diabetes mellitus affects 21 million Americans ; an additional 41 million individuals in this country have impaired glucose tolerance .	0
These individuals are at high risk for developing not only diabetes , but eventually dying from the cardiovascular complications associated with chronic exposure to hyperglycemia .	0
Not only do patients with diabetes carry a 1.5 - to 4.5-fold increased risk of cardiovascular mortality , any microvascular complications they develop such as retinopathy , neuropathy , and nephropathy can have a profoundly negative effect on their quality of	0
Even mild hyperglycemia is associated with macrovascular disease .	0
Similarly , hyperglycemia that occurs concurrently during an acute myocardial infarction or stroke is associated with worse outcomes .	0
Therefore , evidence suggests that both chronic and acute hyperglycemia lead to higher morbidity and mortality .	0
As people age , their 2-hour postchallenge blood glucose level typically increases , often independent of their fasting glucose level .	1
At diagnosis , 25 % of patients with type 2 diabetes have normal fasting glucose levels .	1
The incidence of isolated impaired glucose tolerance is approximately 3 times greater than isolated impaired fasting glucose .	1
Therefore , most patients with asymptomatic diabetes have isolated postchallenge hyperglycemia .	1
A growing body of literature supports targeting postprandial hyperglycemia to lower glycosylated hemoglobin ( A1C ) levels and reduce microvascular and macrovascular complications associated with chronic hyperglycemia .	0
This article will evaluate a typical patient case and strategies employed by the patient and health care provider .	0
Seventy two spinal cord injured subjects ( 63 males and 9 females ) with long-standing lesions ( mean 110 months , range 43-187 ) were admitted to the Sunnaas Hospital for routine examination ( questionnaire , neurological status , radiography , urodynamics , blood	4
The subjects were divided into three groups with Low - ( peak VO2 less than 15 ml/kg/min ) , Medium - ( 15 less than VO2 greater than 25 ) and High - ( VO2 greater than 25 ) endurance capacity .	1
The rate of urinary tract infections ( UTIs ) and osteoporotic leg bones , was significantly reduced with increasing oxygen uptake ( p less than 0.05 , X2 test ) .	2
Differences in scores for ADL-independency ( ADL = Activities of daily living ) and ambulation on crutches with braces , were even more pronounced between the L , M and H groups ( p less than 0.001 ) .	2
The same trends , although not always statistically significant , were also observed in a homogeneous group of paraplegic patients ( n = 43 , injury level below T6 ) .	2
The results emphasise the importance of regular physical endurance activities to patient well-being , because relatively high endurance capacity was found to be related to less frequent medical complications , and to a higher degree of ADL self-independency	2
Studies aimed at characterizing the operation of cognitive functions in normal individuals have examined data from patients with focal cerebral insult .	0
These studies assume that brain damage impairs functions of the cognitive processes along lines that honour the ` normal ' pre-morbid organization of the cognitive system .	0
For example , detailed study of individual brain-damaged patients has revealed apparently selective disruption of cognitive functions such as auditory/verbal working memory , phonological processing ability , grapheme-to-phoneme translation procedures and se	0
Warrington et al. have studied patients with even more fine-grained selective disturbances of the semantic system .	0
The most selective deficits have been reported for four patients who were significantly better at identifying inanimate objects than they were at identifying living things and foods .	0
These patterns of selective deficit after localized brain damage provide important information about the normal organization of the lexicon , and ultimately about how components of the lexical system are related to particular neural substrates .	0
Here , we report a case study of a patient demonstrating a very selective disturbance of the ability to name items from two related semantic categories .	4
Despite normal performance on a large battery of lexical/semantic tasks , the patient shows a consistent and striking disability in naming members of the semantic categories of ` fruits ' and ` vegetables ' .	2
The selectivity of this deficit supports a category-specific organization of the mental lexicon , and suggests independence of the processing routes involving naming and name recognition .	2
Patients with severe decompensated congestive heart failure ( CHF ) commonly exhibit acid-base and electrolyte disturbances mainly due to the activation of several neurohumoral mechanisms as well as to drugs regularly used in this population .	0
Magnesium deficit is not infrequently observed in CHF patients but its pathophysiology remains less well-studied as compared with other electrolyte alterations , such as hypokalemia .	0
However , there is evidence that early detection and correction of magnesium abnormalities could obviate potentially deleterious arrhythmogenic effects .	0
To assess the incidence of magnesium level disorders and analyze the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in patients with CHF .	1
Eighty-six consecutive CHF patients ( NYHA class III or IV ) admitted to our hospital over a period of 5 years were studied .	4
Patients with diabetes mellitus , liver or renal failure , and chronic obstructive lung disease were excluded .	1
All patients received conventional treatment with digoxin , diuretic agents and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor .	3
On admission , blood and urine electrolytes and renal function parameters were determined .	1
Arterial blood gases and serum anion gap determinations were also performed .	1
Hypomagnesemia was found in 15 [ n = 15 ( 17.4 % ) ] CHF patients .	2
The majority of these patients also exhibited other electrolyte abnormalities , such as hypokalemia , hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia .	2
Inappropriate magnesiuria ( fractional excretion of magnesium > 4 % ) was evident in eight hypomagnesemic patients .	2
A variety of associated conditions , including poor dietary intake , also favored magnesium depletion .	2
Magnesium deficit is a common electrolyte disorder in CHF ( NYHA class III/IV ) patients and several interrelated mechanisms are implicated in its pathogenesis .	2
Clinicians ' awareness of the incidence of hypomagnesemia in this population as well as its related pathophysiology could be useful for the early detection and appropriate treatment to inhibit its arrhythmogenic potential .	2
Recent advances in therapy for multiple sclerosis ( MS ) have centred on the use of the disease-modifying drugs glatiramer acetate ( GA ) and interferon ( IFN ) beta .	0
Several large-scale clinical trials have been carried out on the use of these compounds , but there have been few studies that have directly compared their efficacy in MS.	0
Furthermore , there has been controversy and confusion over the IFN beta therapy regimen that will achieve the best possible clinical outcome for MS patients .	0
This review focuses principally on clinical trials of IFN beta-1a , where data that allow direct comparison of different treatment regimens are now available .	3
Current data indicate that IFN beta , and in particular IFN beta-1a , has important advantages over GA in the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS ( RRMS ) .	2
Additionally , IFN beta-1a ( Rebif , Serono ) , 44 microg administered subcutaneously ( s.c. ) three times weekly ( t.i.w. ) , is significantly more effective than IFN beta-1a ( Avonex , Biogen ) , 30 microg administered intramuscularly once weekly .	2
For optimal management of RRMS , treatment with IFN beta-1a , 44 microg s.c. t.i.w. , should begin as early as possible after diagnosis .	2
The objective was to study the effectiveness of a modified washing toilet seat equipped with a CCD camera monitor and an electronic bidet to facilitate precise hitting of the anal area with water streams to stimulate bowel movement in patients with spinal	0
There were 20 subjects , all of whom had traumatic SCI , were at least 5 mos post acute injury , and could change their position on the toilet seat while watching the monitor .	4
Stimulation of bowel movement with the modified toilet seat was provided for a maximum of 30 mins .	3
Success or failure to induce bowel movement was evaluated as related to injury level , ASIA impairment scale , and ability to voluntarily increase anorectal pressure , measured with a manometory .	1
Bowel movement was successfully induced in 15 of the 20 patients ( 75 % ) .	2
Success was not related significantly to injury level , ASIA impairment scale , or ability to voluntarily squeeze .	2
Compared with their usual manner of bowel management , for which they spent more than 30 mins , time needed for successful bowel movement was shortened in 11 of 13 patients .	2
No complications were observed .	2
This preliminary study suggests that our newly modified washing toilet seat with a monitoring system could be a useful alternative for bowel management in patients with SCI .	2
There is increasing realization among health care administrative decision makers and service providers that we must measure the true value of expensive services by demonstrating the achievement of identified goals .	0
The objective of this study was to determine whether clients who received the home-based intervention for a hip arthroplasty would result in a more timely discharge home from hospital .	1
Two hundred and eight clients receiving a total hip replacement at two acute care hospitals comprised the sample .	4
One hospital included the more costly home-based pre-operative teaching by an occupational therapist as part of its protocol while the other provided comparative occupational therapy intervention within its hospital based pre-admission clinic .	3
Discharge disposition and length of hospital stay were measured .	1
Though no significant difference in either of these outcomes was found , a number of issues were raised indicating the complexity of resource allocation to this client population and the importance of the qualitative dimensions of care .	1
The location for pre-operative teaching for total hip replacements was not found to impact the length of hospital stay nor whether clients are discharged directly home .	2
Nociceptive inputs from primary afferents are primarily mediated at fast glutamatergic synapses onto second order neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord through activation of AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptor subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors	0
At these glutamatergic synapses several forms of short-lasting and long-lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission are known .	0
Enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission in nociceptive pathways is thought to be a key neural substrate underlying chronic pain , and thus the cellular and molecular mechanisms producing this enhancement represent potential targets for developing n	0
Central to the mechanisms for pain hypersensitivity is the NMDA receptor , the activity of which is facilitated by convergent intracellular biochemical cascades in dorsal horn neurons .	0
Cellular changes are not restricted to neurons in the dorsal horn , however , and there is growing evidence for involvement of glia , and of glia-neuronal signaling , in initiating and sustaining enhancement of nociceptive transmission .	0
In particular , a role has emerged for microglia in pain hypersensitivity following nerve injury .	1
This expanded understanding of cellular and molecular signalling mechanisms in the dorsal horn , that includes both neurons and glia , provides a basis of creating new types of strategies for management , and also for diagnosis , of chronic pain .	2
The present investigation examines the phenomenology of episodic symptoms in dysfunctioning children and adolescents following mild ( n = 25 ) or severe ( n = 25 ) traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) .	0
TBI patients in both groups commonly endorsed symptoms such as staring spells , memory gaps , and temper outbursts .	1
Anticonvulsant response in the 27 patients treated , reflected moderate to substantial improvement in 92 % .	2
A dose-response relationship between injury severity and number of episodic symptoms was not observed ; however , patients in the severe TBI sample did produce significantly more defective performances on a dichotic word-listening task ( DWLT ) and lower IQ v	2
Defective DWLT performance was also significantly associated with greater number of episodic symptoms endorsed , but only in the mild TBI sample .	2
To identify protective behaviors and risk factors associated with the development of pressure ulcers ( PUs ) after spinal cord injury ( SCI ) .	0
Logistic regression was then used to identify the variables most strongly associated with PU outcomes .	1
Data were collected by case managers employed by the Arkansas Spinal Cord Commission , an agency that provides services to persons with SCI .	1
A total of 650 of 991 eligible individuals with SCI from a statewide population-based SCI registry participated .	4
All ambulatory participants were eliminated , leaving 560 patients .	1
Average age of the respondents was 27.2 years at injury ( median age , 25yr ) and 43.6 years at the time of the survey ( median age , 42yr ) .	1
A 200-item interview was developed to measure a broad range of outcomes associated with SCI ( including secondary conditions such as PUs ) , as well as risk and protective behaviors related to these outcomes .	1
Several characteristics and behaviors were related to PU outcomes .	2
Being underweight ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 2.18 ) , having used medications to treat pain ( OR = 1.33 ) or spasticity ( OR = 1.31 ) , having smoked at least 100 cigarettes over a lifetime ( OR = 1.31 ) , and being a current smoker ( OR = 1.21 ) were associated with having	2
Having completed a college degree ( OR = 0.23 ) , being married ( OR = 0.49 ) , and being currently employed ( OR = 0.54 ) were associated with a lower risk of having a PU in the past year .	2
Being underweight ( OR = 1.94 ) , having a history of incarceration ( OR = 1.78 ) , having attempted suicide ( OR = 1.71 ) , and reporting alcohol or drug treatment ( OR = 1.65 ) were associated with having been hospitalized for a PU since injury .	2
This study was unable to evaluate the efficacy of traditional health maintenance or protective behaviors for PUs , such as weight shifts or skin checks .	2
PUs are least likely to occur among individuals who maintain normal weight , return to a work and family role , and who do not have a history of tobacco use , suicidal behaviors , or self-reported incarcerations , or alcohol or drug abuse .	2
Additional research is needed to identify better the risk factors for the occurrence of PUs .	2
Obesity and type 2 diabetes are world wide health issues and their incidence is rapidly increasing .	0
Currently the biological factors responsible for the development of obesity are only partially understood .	0
Recent research has shown that maternal nutrition during pregnancy may have long-term metabolic consequences in offspring .	0
In the present study we investigated interactions between prenatal and postnatal nutrition on leptin sensitivity and obesity development .	1
Wistar rats were time-mated and randomly assigned to either ad-libitum ( AD ) or to 30 % of ad-libitum ( UN ) food intake throughout pregnancy .	4
After weaning , female offspring were fed standard chow , a high-fat diet or a calorie restricted diet .	1
Female offspring of UN dams were growth retarded at birth and showed increased susceptibility to diet-induced obesity on a high-fat diet .	2
At 142 + / - 5 days of age , leptin sensitivity was measured as a response to 14 days of leptin treatment ( 2.5 microg/g/day , s.c. ) .	2
In UN offspring fed chow , leptin treatment failed to reduce food intake and weight loss was diminished .	2
This leptin resistance observed in UN offspring was independent of diet-induced obesity and was associated with fasting hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia .	2
Our study suggests that prenatal nutrition can shape future susceptibility to obesity through alterations in leptin sensitivity and changes in energy metabolism during adult life .	2
This study assessed the first year of a regional general practitioner ( GP ) open-access neuroimaging service , to determine diagnostic yield and influence on patient management .	4
Overall , 48.1 % of examinations demonstrated a radiologically significant abnormality with 64.1 % of spinal imaging examinations demonstrating significant findings .	2
Utilised appropriately , a regional open-access neuroimaging service has good diagnostic yield and may influence the management of most referred patients .	2
This paper is a presentation of a study protocol to establish the prevalence of orthopaedic problems ( hip dislocation , pelvic obliquity , spinal deformity and contractures ) and their impact on pain , function , participation and health in a population of children and young people with severe cerebral palsy .	1
Cerebral palsy is the commonest cause of motor impairment in childhood and is associated with life-long disability .	0
An estimated 30 % of people with cerebral palsy have severe forms and are non-ambulant .	0
Although the underlying neurological damage is not amenable to correction , many health services are dedicated to providing therapeutic and adaptive support to help people with the condition reach their potential .	0
A cross-sectional survey of children and young people , aged 4-25 years with severe , non-ambulant cerebral palsy as defined using the Gross Motor Function Classification System ( Levels IV and V ) .	4
Study participants will be identified from a pre-existing , geographically defined case register and recruited via a healthcare professional known to them .	1
Two assessments will be undertaken : one involving parents/carers at home and using questionnaires ; the other involving the child/young person ideally in one of three settings and including X-rays if clinically indicated .	3
This study will contribute to our knowledge of the history and epidemiology of orthopaedic problems in children and young people with cerebral palsy and how these problems accumulate and impact on participation , health and well-being .	2
The study will also identify unmet need and make recommendations for good practice in relation to the orthopaedic care and management for people with severe cerebral palsy .	2
An inception cohort design was used to study a consecutive sample of back-injured workers .	4
To refine and to test the Vermont Disability Prediction Questionnaire 's ability to indicate an individual 's relative risk for chronic disability after occupational low back injury .	0
Although most back-injured workers return to work quickly , the minority who do not account for the majority of associated costs and health care .	1
Early identification of workers at high risk for disability would facilitate intervention strategies .	0
During the study recruitment period , people aged 18-60 years reporting occupational low back injury to the Vermont Department of Labor and Industry within 11 days of onset were eligible .	4
A Vermont Disability Prediction Questionnaire was mailed to the 442 subjects who could be contacted and who gave informed consent .	1
One hundred sixty-three of the 166 subjects who completed and returned the questionnaire within 15 days of initial injury were telephoned 3 months later to determine work status .	1
Those who returned the questionnaire were compared with those who would not consent or did not return the questionnaire in time according to age , sex , residence , wages , work hours per week , and length of employment .	1
Employment status ( inability to work because of low back pain ) was evaluated by telephone interview 3 months after initial injury .	1
The follow-up interviewer was blinded to the Vermont Disability Prediction Questionnaire scores .	2
of the 163 subjects , 16 ( 10 % ) were not working because of low back pain .	2
Using a simple dichotomous scoring system for 11 questionnaire items , a cut-off score of 0.48 identified 3-month postinjury work status , with 0.94 sensitivity and 0.84 specificity .	2
The Vermont Disability Prediction Questionnaire is a brief , easily administered and scored tool for identifying back-injured workers at relative risk for chronic disability .	2
Such early identification should increase the efficiency of disability prevention strategies by directing them toward people who need them most .	2
The accuracy of the questionnaire needs to be tested in a variety of different clinical and socioeconomic settings .	2
Adequate and intensive rehabilitation is an important requirement for successful Total Knee Arthroplasty .	0
The primary focus of early rehabilitation is ambulation of patients and regaining range of motion in the knee.Although research suggests that Continuous Passive Motion should be implemented in the first rehabilitation phase following surgery , there is sub	0
A Cochrane review on this topic concluded that short-term use of CPM leads to greater short-term range of motion .	1
It also suggested , however , that future research should concentrate on the treatment period during which CPM should be administered .	1
In a randomised controlled trial we intend to investigate the efficacy of prolonged use of a continuous passive motion ( CPM ) device in the home situation as an adjunct to standardised physical therapy .	3
The experimental treatment is compared to standardised physical therapy , in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) .	4
Efficacy will be assessed in terms of faster improvements in range of motion and functional recovery.Seventy patients with knee osteoarthritis undergoing TKA and experiencing early postoperative flexion impairment ( less than 80 degrees of knee flexion at the time of discharge ) will be randomised over two treatment groups , a usual care group and an experimental group .	1
The experimental group will receive CPM + physiotherapy for 17 consecutive days after surgery , whereas the usual care group will receive the same treatment during the in-hospital phase ( i.e. about four days ) , followed by physical therapy alone ( usual care ) in the first two weeks after hospital discharge.From 18 days to three months after discharge , both groups will receive standardised PT .	1
The primary focus of rehabilitation will be functional recovery ( e.g. ambulation ) and regaining range of motion ( ROM ) in the knee .	1
Because restricted knee ROM affects functional activities , knee ROM and knee function are regarded as the primary indicators of successful TKA .	2
Potential effects of the intervention under study include rapid return of knee flexion accompanied by earlier return to functional activities of daily life .	2
If patients benefit significantly from prolonged CPM use , this treatment should be added to the standard PT treatment at home.We expect the additional home CPM programme to be more effective than the usual physiotherapy programme , resulting in a differenc	2
This clinically important difference , with a possible flexion ROM of about 100 degrees , is expected to lead to better functioning in activities of daily life , like walking , and earlier ability to cycle .	2
These advantages should result in earlier and increasing independence .	2
The aim of this study was to examine the perception of low back pain care and consequences according to what Deyo refers to as seven `` myths '' about back pain , in the Norwegian population .	0
In spring 2001 , seven questions , corresponding to Deyo 's myths , were included in an opinion poll ( telephone interviews ) of a representative sample ( n = 1015 ) of the Norwegian population .	4
In total , 41 % of the population held that ` If you have a slipped disc you must have surgery ' .	2
Approximately 50 % believed that ` X-ray and newer imaging tests can always identify the cause of pain ' and ` Most back pain is caused by injury and heavy lifting ' .	2
Almost 60 % agreed that ` Everyone with back pain should have a spine X-ray ' .	2
However , only one-quarter believed that ` If your back hurts , you should take it easy until the pain goes away ' , and approximately one-fifth believed that ` Back pain is usually disabling ' .	2
Only 12 % believed that ` Bed rest is the mainstay of therapy ' .	2
More individuals in the lower - compared with the higher-educated groups believed in the myths .	2
Information concerning current knowledge on healthcare and health consequences of low back pain had reached only a small part of the general population .	2
The most important factor for lack of knowledge was education .	2
Developing effective methods to promote adequate self-care and treatment and reduce the risk of chronicity of low back pain in the lower-educated groups should be a top priority .	2
Clonidine has been suggested as an alternative pharmacotherapy for patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and comorbid tic disorders .	0
To examine the efficacy of clonidine in this population of children , the use of clonidine in the treatment of children with ADHD with and without comorbid tic disorders was examined in a retrospective chart review of 54 children over a 4-year period .	4
Treatment was administered openly to these patients in a Pediatric Psychopharmacology Clinic , and response was assessed using clinical global improvement measures .	1
Clonidine treatment resulted in improvement in both the ADHD ( 39/54 ; 72 % ) and tic symptoms ( 18/24 ; 75 % ) groups .	2
The findings suggested that the children with ADHD with comorbid tic disorders ( 23/24 ; 96 % ) have a more frequent positive behavioral response to clonidine than children with ADHD without comorbid tic disorders ( 16/30 ; 53 % ) .	2
This report provides further support of a role for clonidine in the treatment of children with ADHD , particularly for those with comorbid tic disorders .	2
The aim of this study was to characterize the distribution , timing , and risk factors for psychiatric comorbidity in children with recent onset epilepsy .	0
Children aged 8 to 18 years with recent onset epilepsy ( < 1 year in duration ) of idiopathic etiology ( n = 53 ) and a healthy comparison group ( n = 50 ) underwent a structured psychiatric diagnostic interview to characterize the spectrum of lifetime-to-date hi	4
There was no significant difference between the children with recent onset epilepsy and healthy comparison children in sex ( 31 males , 22 females vs 23 males , 27 females ) or mean age 12.7 y [ SD 3.3 ] vs 12.7 y [ SD 3.2 ] ) .	2
Children with recent onset epilepsy exhibited an elevated rate of lifetime-to-date Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 4th edition ( DSM-IV ) Axis I disorders compared with the comparison group .	2
They showed significantly higher rates of depressive disorders ( 22.6 vs. 4 % , p = 0.01 ) , anxiety disorders ( 35.8 vs 22 % , p < 0.05 ) , and attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder ( 26.4 vs 10 % , p = 0.01 ) with elevated but less prevalent rates of oppositional def	2
A subset of children with epilepsy ( 45 % ) exhibited DSM-IV Axis I disorders before the first recognized seizure , suggesting the potential influence of antecedent neurobiological factors that remain to be identified .	2
The increased prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity antedating epilepsy onset may be consistent with the presence of underlying neurobiological influences independent of seizures , epilepsy syndrome , and medication treatment .	2
Epidemiologic evidence suggests a positive association between body mass , adult height , and postmenopausal breast cancer .	0
However , most studies have not been large enough to examine the association across a very wide range of body mass or height , and few studies have assessed the relationship between body mass or height and postmenopausal breast cancer mortality .	1
After 14 years of follow-up , 2852 breast cancer deaths were observed among 424,168 postmenopausal women who were cancer-free at interview .	4
Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to estimate relative risks and to control for potential confounding .	1
Breast cancer mortality rates increased continually and substantially with increasing BMI ( rate ratio ( RR ) = 3.08 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 2.09-4 .51 for BMI > 40.0 compared to BMI 18.5-20 .49 ) .	2
If causal , the multivariate-adjusted RR estimates in this study correspond to approximately 30-50 % of breast cancer deaths among postmenopausal women in the US population being attributable to overweight .	2
Breast cancer mortality also increased with increasing height up to 66 inches with RR = 1.64 , ( 95 % CI = 1.23-2 .18 ) in women 66 inches tall compared to those < 60 inches .	2
Postmenopausal obesity is an important and potentially avoidable predictor of fatal breast cancer in this study .	2
These results underscore the importance of maintaining moderate weight throughout adult life .	2
In this study , we examined the psychometric quality of the recently revised DSM-IV Personality Disorders ( PD ) .	0
A nationally drawn sample of mental health professionals rated 280 patients known to them , using a symptom checklist containing all the DSM-IV PD criteria .	4
From this symptom level data we determined internal consistency , convergent validity , and discriminant validity for each DSM-IV PD criteria .	2
Overall , the findings were encouraging .	2
The internal consistency -- a measure of reliability -- of the PD criteria sets appears to be substantially improved .	2
The median coefficient alpha for the DSM-IV PDs was .73 .	2
Convergent validity was generally adequate for the DSM-IV PD criteria sets .	2
However , discriminant validity , a measure of the specificity of a criterion 's relationship to its parent scale , continues to be a problem of the PDs .	2
The findings suggest that the DSM-IV PDs may have better reliability than did their DSM-III-R predecessors .	2
However , the weak discriminant validity found for the DSM-IV PD criteria sets indicates that the Axis II system will continue to show high levels of comorbidity .	2
The usefulness of psychometric procedures in the development and refinement of the DSM PDs is also highlighted .	2
Retention is the phase of orthodontic treatment that attempts to keep teeth in the corrected positions after orthodontic ( dental ) braces .	0
Without a phase of retention there is a tendency for the teeth to return to their initial position ( relapse ) .	0
To prevent relapse almost every patient who has orthodontic treatment will require some type of retention .	0
To evaluate the effectiveness of different retention strategies used to stabilise tooth position after orthodontic braces .	1
The Cochrane Oral Health Group 's Trials Register , CENTRAL , MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched .	1
Several journals were handsearched .	1
No language restrictions were applied .	1
Authors of randomised controlled trials ( RCTs ) were identified and contacted to identify unpublished trials .	1
Most recent search December 2002 .	1
RCTs on children and adults , who have had retainers fitted or adjunctive procedures undertaken , following orthodontic treatment with braces to prevent relapse .	4
The outcomes are how well the teeth are stabilised , survival of retainers , adverse effects on oral health and quality of life .	1
Screening of eligible studies , assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and data extraction were conducted in duplicate and independently by two reviewers .	1
As no two studies compared the same retention strategies ( interventions ) it was not possible to combine the results of any studies .	1
Four trials satisfied the inclusion criteria .	2
These trials all compared different interventions : circumferential supracrestal fiberotomy ( CSF ) combined with full-time removable retainer versus a full-time removable retainer alone ; circumferential supracrestal fiberotomy ( CSF ) combined with a nights-o	2
There was weak unreliable evidence , based on data from one trial , that there was a statistically significant increase in stability in both the mandibular ( p < 0.001 ) and maxillary anterior segments ( p < 0.001 ) when the CSF was used , compared with wh	2
There was also weak , unreliable evidence that teeth settle quicker with a Hawley retainer than with a clear overlay retainer after 3 months .	2
The quality of the trial reports was generally poor .	2
There are insufficient research data on which to base our clinical practice on retention at present .	2
There is an urgent need for high quality randomised controlled trials in this crucial area of orthodontic practice .	2
The rat forced swimming test ( FST ) distinguishes selective serotonin ( 5-HT ) and selective noradrenaline ( NA ) reuptake-inhibitors , which respectively increase swimming and climbing behaviours .	0
However , NA-system-mediated inhibition of 5-HT-induced swimming prevents dual 5-HT/NA reuptake-inhibition to produce concurrently climbing with swimming .	0
Since adaptative neurochemical processes occur in the treatment of depression , we examined the influence of long-term antidepressant treatment on these interactions .	0
( 1 ) Selective [ fluoxetine : 10 mg/kg ; desipramine : 10 mg/kg ] and non-selective [ milnacipran : 40 mg/kg ; mirtazapine : 20 mg/kg ] antidepressants were administered subacutely ( 3inj ) and chronically ( 17inj ) over 16 days .	3
( 2 ) A subacute fluoxetine-desipramine combination ( 10-10 mg/kg ) was administered in rats that were pre-treated with chronic-desipramine ( 10 mg/kg per day , 14 days ) .	4
( 3 ) NA-system-mediated interactions were further examined by combining the alpha ( 2 ) - receptor agonist clonidine ( 5 , 10 , 20 , 200 microg/kg ) with 10 mg/kg fluoxetine .	3
( 1 )	1
Long-term treatment with either fluoxetine or desipramine does not modify the behavioural response produced by their subacute administration .	2
( 2 ) In contrast , whereas subacute-milnacipran increases climbing solely , chronic-milnacipran produces greater anti-immobility effects and increases both climbing and swimming behaviours .	2
Similarly , the fluoxetine-desipramine combination produces climbing solely , but increases both climbing and swimming behaviours in animals pre-treated with chronic-desipramine .	2
Chronic but not subacute-mirtazapine increases swimming behaviour .	2
( 3 ) clonidine dose-dependently antagonizes fluoxetine-induced anti-immobility effects and swimming behaviour .	2
Chronic enhancement of NA-transmission alters NA-system-mediated inhibition of 5-HT-induced behaviour in the FST , which may involve alpha ( 2 ) - receptors .	2
Chronic relapsing multifocal osteomyelitis ( CRMO ) results in significant morbidity , especially in those with vertebral collapse .	0
Symptomatic benefit with intravenous pamidronate ( PAM ) has been shown ; however , few studies have demonstrated radiological benefit .	0
We describe clinical and radiological data on 7 pediatric cases of CRMO treated with PAM .	4
Retrospective chart review on all children with CRMO treated with PAM .	3
Response to PAM was measured by subjective reports and radiology including vertebral morphometry .	1
Seven patients ( 1 male ) presented with bone pain at a median age of 8 years ( range 5-14 ) .	1
Symptoms had been present for a median of 18 months ( range 11-51 ) before PAM therapy .	1
All patients had involvement of multiple nonspinal sites , 5 children had spinal involvement with vertebral fractures , and 5 had joint involvement .	2
Six cases had symptomatic improvement within 6 months of starting PAM , which was sustained during PAM therapy ( median 26 mo , range 6-41 ) and persisted in the 4 cases who had ceased treatment for the duration of followup ( 27 mo , range 18-51 ) .	2
The least benefit was seen in the 3 cases with synovial joint involvement .	2
The 3 cases with spinal radiological followup showed modeling of vertebral fractures and in one patient improvement in kyphosis .	2
No radiological improvement in nonspinal lesions was seen .	2
PAM therapy was associated with symptomatic improvement and vertebral modeling in children with CRMO .	2
A study was undertaken of 46 patients ( 19 cervical and 27 lumbar ) admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation unit following surgical decompression for myelopathy or cauda equina syndrome resulting from spinal stenosis ( SS ) .	0
Individuals with SS represented 16 percent of all spinal cord injury ( SCI ) admissions .	0
When compared to patients with traumatic SCI , patients with SS were significantly ( t-test , p < .01 ) older ( mean age 68 versus 39 years ) , more frequently retired/unemployed ( 89 percent versus 43 percent ) , more often married ( 57 percent versus 36 percent	2
Significant ( p < .01 ) Functional Independence Measurement ( FIM ) changes for the SS patients were noted after rehabilitation in the categories of self-care , sphincter control and mobility/locomotion .	2
Additionally , outcome comparisons with a group of traumatic SCI patients who had similar motor function revealed similar lengths of stay , discharge FIM scores and discharge-to-community rates .	2
This study suggests that individuals with weakness secondary to SS represent a significant proportion of individuals with SCI , make significant functional gains following inpatient rehabilitation and can achieve functional outcomes similar to those of tra	2
Brachial plexus injuries ( BPIs ) are often devastating events that lead to upper-extremity paralysis , rendering the limb a painful extraneous appendage .	0
Fortunately , there are several nerve repair techniques that provide restoration of some function .	0
Although there is general agreement in the medical community concerning which patients may benefit from surgical intervention , the actual repair technique for a given lesion is less clear .	0
The authors sought to identify and better define areas of agreement and disagreement among experienced peripheral nerve surgeons as to the management of BPIs .	1
The authors developed a detailed survey in two parts one part addressing general issues related to BPI and the other presenting four clinical cases .	1
The survey was mailed to 126 experienced peripheral nerve physicians and 49 ( 39 % ) participated in the study .	4
The respondents represent 22 different countries and multiple surgical subspecialties .	1
They performed a mean of 33 brachial plexus reconstructions annually .	1
Areas of significant disagreement included the timing and indications for surgical intervention in birth-related palsy , treatment of neuroma-in-continuity , the best transfers to achieve elbow flexion and shoulder abduction , the use of intra - or extraplexal donors for motor neurotization , and the use of distal or proximal coaptation during nerve transfer .	1
Experienced peripheral nerve surgeons disagree in important ways as to the management of BPI .	2
The decisions made by the various treating physicians underscore the many areas of disagreement regarding the treatment of BPI , including the diagnostic approach to defining the injury , timing of and indications for surgical intervention in birth-related	2
To identify reports of randomized trials by handsearching 2 Bahrain medical journals , which are indexed in the biomedical database EMBASE and to determine any added value of the handsearching by comparing the reports found by handsearching with what would	0
All issues of the Bahrain Medical Bulletin ( BMB ) ( 1979-2004 ) and the Journal of the Bahrain Medical Society ( JBMS ) ( 1989-2004 ) were handsearched in February 2005 for reports of RCTs or Controlled Clinical Trials ( CCTs ) , according to Cochrane eligibility criteria .	1
Out of 395 articles in BMB we found reports of 12 RCTs and 4 CCTs .	1
Distribution by country of corresponding author Jordan ( 4 RCTs , one CCT ) , Bahrain ( one RCT , one CCT ) , India ( 3 RCTs , one CCT ) , Kuwait ( one CCT ) , Saudi Arabia ( 2 RCTs ) , USA/Bahrain ( one RCT ) , and Oman ( one RCT ) ; and by specialty Anesthesia ( 8 ) , Surgery ( 1 ) Pediatrics ( 1 ) , Radiotherapy ( 1 ) , Community Medicine ( 1 ) , Sports Medicine ( 1 ) , Obstetrics/Gynecology ( 3 ) .	1
The Journal of the Bahrain Medical Society included reports of 14 RCTs and 3 CCTs , out of 97 articles .	1
Distribution by country of corresponding author Jordan ( 9 RCTs , 2 CCTs ) , Bahrain ( 3 RCTs ) , Egypt ( one RCT ) , Kuwait ( one RCT ) , and Saudi Arabia ( one RCT ) ; and by specialty Anesthesia ( 7 ) , General Surgery ( 3 ) , Obstetrics/Gynecology ( 1 ) , Radiotherapy ( 1 ) , Pediatrics ( 1 ) , Orthopaedic Surgery ( 1 ) , Education ( 1 ) Ear Nose and Throat ( 1 ) Ophthalmology ( 1 ) .	1
Overall , of the 33 reports of trials found by handsearching both journals , only 23 were included in EMBASE of which only 6 had been indexed with the term RCT .	2
Of the 23 reports of trials included in EMBASE , 16 had been identified in the Collaboration s systematic search of EMBASE .	2
Two reports of trials could have been retrieved by this search but there was insufficient information in the title and abstract to code these as trials .	2
The EMBASE records for the remaining 5 reports of trials did not contain terms currently used by The Cochrane Collaboration to identify reports of randomized trials in this database .	1
The handsearching of these journals will help minimize publication bias by locating randomized trials not previously identified and , through their inclusion in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) in The Cochrane Library , will ensu	2
To study the effect of the presence of coarse granules in the perivitelline space ( PVS ) of oocytes on embryonic development , and on implantation and pregnancy rates in IVF .	0
The study population included 24 patients treated during the period 1995-2000 .	4
The majority or all of their oocytes exhibited repeatedly coarse granulation in the PVS .	1
Clinical and laboratory cycle characteristics of their 65 IVF-ICSI cycles and the resulting implantation and pregnancy rates were compared to a matched control group of 65 IVF - ICSI cycles without granulation in the PVS .	1
A total of 623 oocytes were retrieved , 418 oocytes fertilized , and 246 embryos were transferred in the study group .	1
No difference was detected between the study and control group with regard to patients ' clinical data , IVF cycle characteristics , mean number of oocytes retrieved and fertilized , and mean number of embryos transferred .	2
Only seven pregnancies were achieved in the study group , leading to pregnancy and implantation rates of 10.7 and 5.7 % , respectively .	2
Pregnancy and implantation rates were significantly higher in the control group of matched IVF-ICSI cycles without granulation in the PVS ( 32.5 and 11.5 % , respectively ) .	2
The presence of coarse granules in the PVS correlates with low implantation and pregnancy rates in IVF-ICSI cycles and might be regarded as a distinct entity , part of the yet poorly defined condition of `` egg factor infertility . ''	2
Since 1974 , 56 children with a neuropathic bladder were selected for intermittent or indwelling catheterisation .	4
Indications for catheterisation included incontinence , hydronephrosis , and/or difficulty with bladder expression .	0
Good results were obtained in 70 % of girls and 50 % of boys .	2
The catheter was abandoned in 7 children , mainly because of lack of cooperation from the parents .	2
Deterioration occurred only in those children with both hydronephrosis and vesico-ureteric reflux prior to catheterisation .	2
Of the latter group of children , 33 % suffered upper tract deterioration , and we now consider vesico-ureteric reflux to be a relative contra-indication to catheterisation , except in those children with severe disabilities and deformities , in whom antireflu	2
Indwelling penile catheters should not be recommended for boys , but catheterisation via a perineal urethrostomy may prove helpful in those unable either to catheterise themselves intermittently or to wear a penile appliance .	2
Injury in the home is extremely common , accounting for around a third of all injuries .	0
The majority of injuries of children under five and people aged 75 and over occur at home .	0
Multi-factorial injury prevention interventions have been shown to reduce injuries in the home .	0
However , few studies have focussed specifically on the impact of physical adaptations to the home environment and the effectiveness of such intervention needs to be ascertained .	0
To review the evidence for the effect on injuries of modification of the home environment with a primary focus on interventions to reduce physical hazards .	3
We searched the following databases APId , ASSIA , British Nursing Index , CINAHL , Cochrane Library databases , Dissertation Abstracts , EMBASE , HealthSTAR , ICONDA , ISI Science ( and Social Science ) Citation Index , MEDLINE , National Research Register , PREMEDLINE , SIGLE and Urbadisk .	1
Conference proceedings and reference lists were scanned .	1
Experts in the field and trialists were contacted .	1
Searches were not restricted to English language .	1
Handsearching of relevant journals was not conducted .	1
Randomised controlled trials , non-randomised controlled trials , controlled before-and-after studies and interrupted time series studies .	1
All abstracts were screened by two reviewers for relevance , outcome and design .	1
Two reviewers independently evaluated methodological quality and extracted data from each eligible study .	1
We found 28 published trials and one unpublished study .	1
Trials were not sufficiently similar to allow for the combination of data by statistical analyses , so this review takes a narrative form .	2
Studies were divided into three groups based on the primary population sample : children , older people and the general population .	2
None of the 11 childhood studies demonstrated a reduction in injuries that might have been due to environmental adaptation in the home .	2
One study reported a reduction in injuries and in hazards but the two could not be linked .	2
The majority of studies used hazard reduction as the outcome .	2
Of the 15 studies in older people , none demonstrated a reduction in injuries due to hazard reduction , although two demonstrated a reduction in falls that could be due to hazard reduction .	2
In the mixed age group there were two trials ; neither demonstrated an effect on injuries .	2
There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of interventions to modify environmental home hazards .	2
Further interventions to reduce hazards in the home should be evaluated by adequately designed randomised controlled trials measuring injury outcomes .	2
Recruitment of large study samples to measure effect may be a major consideration for future trials .	2
To determine whether nursing home residents with urinary incontinence ( UI ) have worse quality of life ( QoL ) than continent residents , whether the relationship between UI and QoL differs across strata of cognitive and functional impairment , and whether cha	0
All Medicare - or Medicaid-licensed nursing homes in Kansas , Maine , Mississippi , New York , and South Dakota during 1994 to 1996 .	1
All residents aged 65 and older , excluding persons unable to void or with potentially unstable continence or QoL status ( recent nursing home admission , coexistent delirium , large change in functional status , comatose , near death ) .	4
UI was defined as consistent leakage at least twice weekly over 3 months and continence as consistent dryness over 3 months .	1
QoL was measured using the validated MDS-derived Social Engagement Scale .	1
Of 133,111 eligible residents , 90,538 had consistent continence status , 58,850 ( 65 % ) of whom were incontinent .	2
UI was significantly associated with worse QoL in residents with moderate cognitive and functional impairment .	2
New or worsening UI over 6 months was associated with worse QoL ( odds ratio = 1.46 , 95 % confidence interval = 1.36-1 .57 ) and was second only to cognitive decline and functional decline in predicting worse QoL .	2
This is the first study to quantitatively demonstrate that prevalent and new or worsening UI decreases QoL even in frail , functionally and cognitively impaired nursing home residents .	2
These results provide a crucial incentive to improve continence care and quality in nursing homes and a rationale for targeting interventions to those residents most likely to benefit .	2
The surgical treatment of children with spastic cerebral palsy should be directed at all the problems of the child rather than focusing on one problem area at a time .	0
Although the difficulties encountered by these children can be divided into separate areas for discussion , treating one problem without consideration of the others will result in unnecessary additional hospitalization for subsequent operations .	0
In addition , since each joint is intimately linked to another , surgical treatment of one joint problem may lead to worsening of an adjacent joint deformity unless it too is addressed .	0
Thus , the surgical care of the lower extremities in spastic cerebral palsy requires that the entire patient be evaluated and all necessary surgical procedures be coordinated .	0
The diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is sometimes difficult to establish early in the disease process , particularly in the absence of its classic hallmarks .	0
Our aim was to compare the practical usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) of the hand versus anticyclic citrullinated peptide ( anti-CCP ) antibody testing to confirm the diagnosis of clinically suspected RA in the absence of rheumatoid factor ( RF	0
We prospectively included patients with early inflammatory arthritis and strong clinical suspicion of RA , in whom initial complementary tests ( RF and radiographs of hands , wrists , and feet ) did not provide unequivocal confirmation of the diagnosis .	4
In all patients , anti-CCP antibodies were assessed and contrast-enhanced MRI of the most affected hand was performed according to a specifically designed protocol .	3
The MRI criterion for the diagnosis of RA was either the presence of synovitis with bone erosions or bone marrow edema , which is currently considered to be a forerunner of erosions .	1
In the 40 patients ( 28 women ) , the mean age at diagnosis was 54 + / - 6 years and the median duration of symptoms was 4 + / - 2.6 months ( range 1.5 to 12 ) .	2
Final diagnoses at 1-year follow-up were RA in 31 patients , undifferentiated arthritis in 7 ( 5 self-limiting ) , and psoriatic arthropathy ( PsA ) and antisynthetase syndrome in 1 patient each .	2
Anti-CCP antibodies were positive only in 7 patients , all of whom were finally diagnosed with RA .	2
The prevalence of anti-CCP positivity in our series of seronegative RA patients was thus 23 % ( 7/31 ) ; in these patients the anti-CCP antibodies had a specificity of 100 % ( 95 % CI : 71.7 to 100 ) and sensitivity of 23 % ( 95 % CI : 9.6 to 41.1 ) .	2
Use of the MRI criterion led to the correct diagnosis in 100 % of patients with RA and to false-positive results ( 1 with PsA and 1 with antisynthetase syndrome ) .	2
The MRI criterion had a specificity of 78 % ( 95 % CI : 40.0 to 97.2 ) and sensitivity of 100 % ( 95 % CI : 90.8 to 100 ) for identification of seronegative RA .	2
Although the tests are not mutually exclusive , in our experience MRI is more helpful than anti-CCP antibody determination in confirming the diagnosis of clinically suspected early RA in patients in whom the diagnosis can not be confirmed using conventional	2
A multicascade of leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions is involved in the trafficking of inflammatory lymphocytes into tissue .	0
The primary contact between leukocytes and endothelium is mediated by selectins .	0
Ligands for P-Selectin are preferentially expressed on Th1 cells and thereby allow migration of these inflammatory cells through the vessel wall .	0
Since a peripheral and local Th1-type cytokine profile is present in spontaneous human abortion ( SA ) , opposed by a Th2 dominant situation in normal pregnancies ( NP ) , we investigated ( 1 ) the phenotype of peripheral Th1 cells by flow cytometry , as well as t	4
We observed enhanced production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in CD8 ( + ) , CD3 ( + ) , and CD56 ( + ) blood cells , as well as an increase in the number of CCR5 ( + ) cells in patients suffering from SA compared to those with NP .	1
No difference was detectable with respect to the serum levels of the two cytokines .	2
Using IHC methods , we observed increased staining intensity of P-Selectin ( + ) vessels in samples of SA patients .	2
E-Selectin was only weakly expressed in decidual endothelial cells , with no difference between NP and SA .	2
In SA samples , E-Selectin ( + ) stromal cells were exclusively present .	2
We further detected increased numbers of decidual CD8 ( + ) , CD3 ( + ) , CCR5 ( + ) , and CD56 ( + ) cells in SA patients .	2
We propose that Th1 lymphocyte migration into decidua is enhanced in SA due to upregulated P-Selectin expression in decidual vessels .	2
This increase of Th1-producing lymphocytes might be involved in the rejection of trophoblasts .	2
Emerging evidence indicates an association between cognitive function and physical performance in late life .	0
This study examines the relationship between cognitive function and subsequent gait speed decline among high-functioning older adults .	0
Measures of global cognitive function ( Modified Mini Mental State Examination [ 3MS ] ) and executive control function ( ECF ) ( a clock drawing task [ CLOX 1 ] and the 15-item Executive Interview [ EXIT 15 ] ) were obtained in the Health , Aging , and Body Composition Study in 1999-2000 .	1
Gait-speed ( meters/second ) was assessed over 20 meters at usual pace .	1
Using a mixed model , we assessed the relationship between baseline cognitive function and gait-speed change over 3 years .	1
Two thousand , three hundred forty-nine older adults ( mean age 75.6 + / - 2.9 years ) completed the assessments .	4
After adjustment for baseline gait speed , a 1-standard-deviation ( SD ) lower performance on each cognitive test was associated with greater gait-speed decline over 3 years : 0.016 m/s for the 3MS ( SD = 8.1 ) , 0.009 m/s for CLOX 1 ( SD = 2.4 ) , and 0.012 m/s fo	2
After adjustment for comorbidities , the effect size was attenuated for 3MS and CLOX 1 , and the association for EXIT 15 was no longer significant .	2
Depression score was most strongly associated with the EXIT 15 effect reduction .	2
Global and executive cognitive functions predict declines in gait speed .	2
The association of ECF with gait speed decline is attenuated by comorbid conditions , particularly depression .	2
Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying these associations may point to new pathways for the treatment of physical decline associated with diminished cognitive function .	2
Balancing risks and benefits of fish consumption is now a high visibility public health topic .	0
Many studies identify health benefits of eating fish , both for prenatal development and adult cardiovascular conditions , partly attributed to omega-3 ( n-3 ) polyunsaturated fatty acids or PUFAs ) .	0
Many reports raise concerns about methylmercury and polychlorinated biphenyl effects on the developing fetal brain ( although adults , too , can manifest methylmercury effects ) .	0
Most reports and advisories focus on recreational or subsistence fish , but the vast majority of people obtain most or all of their fish from commercial sources .	0
Our analysis of the nine most common fish in New Jersey markets , yielded a weighted average methylmercury concentration of 0.23 ug/g ( ppm wet weight ) .	4
There are great disparities in the amount and distribution of both PUFAs and contaminants ) in different fish species .	0
Recognizing that both benefits and harm must be related to dose , we propose a compound dose-response curve , currently based on limited data , to identify a zone of benefit , above the benefit threshold and below the harm threshold .	0
The duration of pregnancy and birth weight improve at a benefit threshold of about 8-15 g/day maternal fish intake .	0
Meta-analyses reveal adult cardiovascular benefits around 7.5-22 .5 g/day bracket ( assuming an 8 ounce/227 g typical meal ) , yielding a midpoint also at 15 g/day , but this is an artifact of the intake stratification .	2
Benefit asymptotes are harder to extract , but are above 45 g/day , and in some studies exceed 100g/day .	2
Using the EPA Reference Dose of 0.1 ug/kg day as a methylmercury threshold , The fish intake threshold for harm converts to 27 g/day ( for a selection of common commercial fish averaging 0.23 ppm MeHg ) to 65 g/day for someone choosing fish low in MeHg ( 0.1	2
However , these are worst case thresholds since the RfD includes uncertainty factors .	2
Some people eat much more than 65 g/day .	2
The shape of the dose-benefit and dose-harm curves require better data for estimating thresholds and asymptotes , which will impact the composite curve .	2
We propose this approach clarifies the kinds of data needed to improve risk communication on `` what should I eat '' .	2
Benefits from fish consumption are confounded by socioeconomic class and/or by the avoidance of more harmful foods that fish replaces , which may be as important a benefit mechanism as the PUFA content .	2
Additional studies with better dose-reconstruction are needed and large scale intervention studies are desirable .	2
Osteoporosis is a progressive skeletal disease , which in many cases remains silent and asymptomatic until a fracture occurs .	0
Vertebral fractures are the earliest and most common osteoporotic fractures .	0
The prevalence of vertebral fractures increases steadily with age , ranging between 20 % for 50-year-old postmenopausal women to 64.5 % for older women .	0
The majority of vertebral fractures are not connected with severe trauma , and only one in three is diagnosed clinically .	0
Usually vertebral fractures are associated with such clinical symptoms as back pain , posture change , loss of height , functional impairment , disability , and diminished quality of live .	0
Women with the most severe vertebral fractures are the most likely to incur further fractures , with as much as 3.4 times the risk of hip fracture , and 12.6 times the risk of new vertebral fractures .	0
Almost 20 % of women will experience another fracture within 1 year after a vertebral fracture .	0
Vertebral fractures are accompanied by increased mortality .	0
The relative risk of death following vertebral fracture is almost 9 times higher .	0
The most important purpose of osteoporosis management in postmenopausal women is prevention of the first vertebral fracture .	0
Raloxifene ( Evista ) is the only SERM approved by the American FDA for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis .	0
It is the first compound with selective estrogen agonist activity in bone and in the cardiovascular system , but with estrogen antagonist activity or no activity in reproductive tissues and breast .	0
Raloxifene reduces the risk of positive estrogen receptor breast cancer , decreases total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol , increases HDL cholesterol , does not increase the risk of endometrial cancer or cause bleeding and spotting .	2
After 3 years of treatment Raloxifene reduces the risk of first vertebral fracture by 55 % .	2
The fracture risk within one year is reduced by as much as 68 % .	2
Continued observation has proved its sustained efficacy in the further reduction of fracture risk by 49 % in the fourth year .	2
Raloxifene treatment does not change the physiological structure of bone quality and does not cause fibrosis , osteomalacia or other toxic effects .	2
To assess the prevalence of urinary incontinence in New Zealand women of European , Maori and Pacific Island descent aged 18 years and over .	0
A questionnaire , designed to be self administered , was sent to a group of 1028 women selected at random from the electoral roll in central Wellington .	1
Incontinence was defined as any involuntary loss of urine .	1
If present , details were sought regarding the occurrence , type , and severity of the incontinence so that the prevalence and nature of the problem within ethnic groups could be determined .	1
The prevalence for Maori women ( 46.8 % ) was significantly greater than for either Pacific Island ( 29.2 % ) or European women ( 31.2 % ) ( chi 2 = 14.02 , p = 0.001 ) .	2
Increasing age , and parity were associated with increasing prevalence of incontinence for all ethnic groups .	2
Of the incontinent women , 9 % were continually incontinent , 28 % once or more daily , and 37 % more than twice monthly .	2
A further 26 % were incontinent less than twice monthly .	2
The most reported type of incontinence was stress incontinence ( 48 % of incontinent women ) , with 27 % reporting urge incontinence , and 21 % a mixed picture of stress and urge .	2
There was no significant difference in the frequency of these symptoms between the different ethnic groups .	2
Fifty per cent of incontinent women reported wanting help for their urinary problems , but only one third had sought medical assistance , with many regarding incontinence as a normal occurrence .	2
Urinary incontinence is common in New Zealand women irrespective of ethnic group .	2
The low proportion of women seeking medical assistance emphasises the need for much greater awareness and public education of what is largely a treatable clinical problem .	2
Urinary incontinence is estimated to affect more than one quarter of the female population .	0
The prevalence varies according to different age groups , and although it is recognised that incontinence is more common in the elderly , a significant number are young with nearly 20 % of female children experiencing episodes of urinary leakage .	0
The medical , personal and social impact of urinary incontinence is substantial , but surprisingly it is largely ignored , both by women with the condition , and by those providing health services to them such that it has been described as ` the hidden epidemi	0
In New Zealand , research has been carried out on the prevalence of urinary incontinence and reasons for not seeking treatment in the European community , but the other major ethnic groups in New Zealand ( Maori and Pacific Island ) have not been investigated	0
The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of urinary incontinence in these ethnic groups and to determine any differences to the prevalence of incontinence in European women in a similar socioeconomic environment .	0
In addition , it was hoped to obtain some understanding of the attitudes of the women in each group to incontinence and their perception of the currently available treatments and medical services .	0
We have used serial visual analogue scores to demonstrate disturbances of the appetite profile in dialysis patients .	0
This is potentially important as dialysis patients are prone to malnutrition yet have a lower nutrient intake than controls .	0
Appetite disturbance may be influenced by accumulation of appetite inhibitors such as leptin and cholecystokinin ( CCK ) in dialysis patients .	0
Fasting blood samples were drawn from 43 controls , 50 haemodialysis ( HD ) and 39 peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) patients to measure leptin and CCK .	4
Hunger and fullness scores were derived from profiles compiled using hourly visual analogue scores .	1
Nutrient intake was derived from 3 day dietary records .	1
Fasting CCK was elevated for PD ( 6.73 + / - 4.42 ng/l vs control 4.99 + / - 2.23 ng/l , P < 0.05 ; vs HD 4.43 + / - 2.15 ng/l , P < 0.01 ) .	2
Fasting CCK correlated with the variability of the hunger ( r = 0.426 , P = 0.01 ) and fullness ( r = 0.52 , P = 0.002 ) scores for PD .	2
There was a notable relationship with the increase in fullness after lunch for PD ( r = 0.455 , P = 0.006 ) .	2
When well nourished PD patients were compared with their malnourished counterparts , CCK was higher in the malnourished group ( P = 0.004 ) .	2
Leptin levels were higher for the dialysis patients than controls ( HD and PD , P < 0.001 ) with pronounced hyperleptinaemia evident in some PD patients .	2
Control leptin levels demonstrated correlation with fullness scores ( e.g. peak fullness , r = 0.45 , P = 0.007 ) but the dialysis patients did not .	2
PD nutrient intake ( energy and protein intake , r = -0.56 , P < 0.0001 ) demonstrated significant negative correlation with leptin .	2
Increased CCK levels appear to influence fullness and hunger perception in PD patients and thus may contribute to malnutrition .	2
Leptin does not appear to affect perceived appetite in dialysis patients but it may influence nutrient intake in PD patients via central feeding centres .	2
OBJECTIVE -- To evaluate whether specialist nurse visits enhance the social integration and perceived health of patients with stroke or alleviate stress in carers in longer term stroke care .	0
SETTING -- Patients with disability related to new stroke who lived in their own homes in the Bradford Metropolitan District .	1
SUBJECTS -- 240 patients aged 60 years or over , randomly allocated to control group ( n = 120 ) or intervention group ( n = 120 ) .	4
Intervention -- Visits by specialist outreach nurses over 12 months to provide information , advice , and support ; minimum of six visits during the first six months .	3
The control group received no visits .	3
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES -- The Barthel index ( functional ability ) , the Frenchay activities index ( social activity ) , the Nottingham health profile ( perceived health status ) .	1
Stress among carers was indicated by the general health questionnaire-28 ( 28 items ) .	1
The nurses recorded their interventions in trial diaries .	1
RESULTS -- There were no significant differences in perceived health , social activities , or stress among carers between the treatment and control groups at any of the assessments points .	2
A subgroup of mildly disabled patients with stroke ( Barthel index 15-19 ) had an improved social outcome at six months ( Frenchay activities index , Median difference 3 ( 95 % confidence interval 0 to 6 ; P = 0.03 ) and for the full 12 months of follow up ( analy	2
No proved strategy yet exists that can be recommended to address the psychosocial difficulties of patients with stroke and their families .	2
A hypothesis is presented concerning the neuronal mechanisms which subserve the sympathetically maintained pains such as causalgia and reflex sympathetic dystrophy .	0
The hypothesis rests on two assumptions : that a high rate of firing in spinal wide-dynamic-range ( WDR ) or multireceptive neurons results in painful sensations ; and that nociceptor responses associated with trauma can produce long-term sensitization of WDR	0
The hypothesis states that chronic sympathetically maintained pains are mediated by activity in low-threshold , myelinated mechanoreceptors , that this afferent activity results from sympathetic efferent actions upon the receptors or upon afferent fibers en	0
This hypothesis is based on known characteristics of these neuronal populations studied in experimental animals and on the observed sensory disturbances reported in patients successfully treated with sympathetic blocks .	0
This hypothesis does not require nerve injury or dystrophic tissue .	0
It explains both the continuous pain and the allodynia that are common to these syndromes and their abolition by sympathetic block .	0
Specific changes are proposed in the diagnosis and treatment of post-traumatic pains .	0
Colorectal cancer is an important disease in the Australian community .	0
Whilst there has been much discussion about the appropriate management of local disease , particularly with respect to the issue of adjuvant therapy , there has been relatively little local discussion of treatment options in metastatic colorectal cancer .	0
The critical principles underlying treatment in this setting are briefly outlined in the present article , indicating wherever possible what options could be considered standard , and based on the available literature , which approaches must still be conside	0
Overall , the results of treatment in this group of patients remain poor .	2
Further clinical trials are required to address the issues affecting patients with metastatic colorectal cancer .	2
With almost a million people dying by suicide worldwide each year , reducing the rate of suicidal behaviour is a priority in many countries .	0
To examine whether additional psychosocial interventions following an episode of self-harm reduce the likelihood of subsequent suicide .	3
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from randomised controlled trials of interventions for people following self-harm .	4
Likelihood of suicide was compared by calculating the pooled root difference in suicide rate with 95 % confidence intervals .	1
We obtained suicide data from 18 studies with a total population of 3918 .	2
Eighteen suicides occurred among people offered active treatment and 19 among those offered standard care ( pooled root difference in suicide rate 0.0,95 % CI -0.03 to 0.03 ) .	2
The overall rate of suicide among people participating in trials was similar to that reported in observational studies of people who self-harm .	2
Results of this meta-analysis do not provide evidence that additional psychosocial interventions following self-harm have a marked effect on the likelihood of subsequent suicide .	2
To investigate heritability and continuum versus categorical approaches to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , using a large-scale twin sample .	0
A cohort of 1,938 families with twins and siblings aged 4 to 12 years , recruited from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Twin Registry , was assessed for ADHD using a DSM-III-R-based maternal rating scale .	4
Probandwise concordance rates and correlations in monozygotic and dizygotic twins and siblings were calculated , and heritability was examined using the De Fries and Fulker regression technique .	1
There was a narrow ( additive ) heritability of 0.75 to 0.91 which was robust across familial relationships ( twin , sibling , and twin-sibling ) and across definitions of ADHD as part of a continuum or as a disorder with various symptom cutoffs .	2
There was no evidence for nonadditive genetic variation or for shared family environmental effects .	2
These findings suggest that ADHD is best viewed as the extreme of a behavior that varies genetically throughout the entire population rather than as a disorder with discrete determinants .	2
This has implications for the classification of ADHD and for the identification of genes for this behavior , as well as implications for diagnosis and treatment .	2
Doctors need to identify and understand the professional behaviours of both themselves and others .	0
In order for students to think critically about these issues we encouraged them to use the tenets of the General Medical Council 's Duties of a Doctor as a framework in which to reflect on the actions of healthcare professionals at work .	0
Although the critical incident technique is a well-known process for encouraging reflection , little is known about its usefulness for assessment purposes in this setting .	0
We aimed to discover the validity , feasibility and educational impact of the critical incident as an assessment method for first year students undertaking guided reflection in the context of their first exposure to multi-professional health and social car	3
First year medical students submitted two critical incidents they had observed during multi-professional health and social care attachments and an evaluation of their experiences .	4
Students engaged in the reflective cycle on the professional behaviours of others providing evidence of a varied range of situations .	2
With adequate preparation , junior students are able to reflect on social and healthcare experiences using the Duties of a Doctor as a framework .	2
Critical incidents are a valid and feasible method for assessing students ' reflections on professionalism , with good educational impact .	2
The objective of this study was to explore the effect of cotreatment with recombinant human growth hormone ( GH ) , gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist ( GnRHa ) and human menopausal gonadotrophin ( HMG ) for induction of ovulation in women with clomiphene r	0
It was designed as a randomized , double-blind , placebo controlled trial in which 30 women with anovulation associated with PCOS who were resistant to clomiphene all received DTRP6-LHRH ( Decapeptyl microcapsules , 3.75 mg , i.m. ) and , 2 weeks later , HMG in a	4
From day 1 of HMG therapy , patients were randomized to receive either human GH ( Norditropin , 12 IU/day , i.m. , for 7 days ) or placebo .	3
The number of ampoules , duration of treatment and daily effective dose of HMG required to achieve ovulation , serum oestradiol concentrations and number of follicles induced , ovulation and pregnancy rates , serum insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) concentrations were measured .	1
There were no significant differences between growth hormone and placebo groups in any of the outcomes measured , other than a growth hormone induced increase in serum insulin and IGF-I levels .	2
We conclude that although GH kinetics are abnormal and GH pituitary reserves generally low in women with PCOS , adjuvant GH treatment to GnRHa/HMG does not influence follicular development or sensitivity in response to gonadotrophins and that it does not s	2
Despite recent advances using more conservative approaches , standard classical radical neck dissection is still one of the most frequently performed procedures in head and neck cancer patients who have advanced metastatic neck disease .	0
The trapezius muscle paralysis following division of the spinal accessory nerve results in severe pain and cosmetic disturbance related to malalignment of the shoulder joint .	0
The objective of this study is to report our results with a newly developed orthosis to prevent and correct shoulder dysfunction following standard radical neck dissection .	1
Thirty-four patients who underwent standard radical neck dissection as a part of their surgical treatment from 1997-2002 were rehabilitated by the shoulder orthosis .	4
Beginning 2 weeks after surgery , the patients were allowed to use their orthosis .	1
By using a standard questionnaire , the pain and activity scores were recorded at the 1st , 3rd , 6th and 12th months postoperatively .	1
Six patients were excluded from the study , of whom two succumbed to their disease and four discontinued the use of the orthosis .	1
Of 28 patients included in the study , 20 ( 72 % ) were completely pain free within 3 months following the surgery .	2
Four patients ( 14 % ) noted their pain level as tolerable , and four patients ( 14 % ) reported no considerable gain in the pain threshold and/or physical activity levels .	2
Despite the fact that the active abduction range increased only 5 to 20 degrees , the relief of pain and improved malalignment of the scapula and consequently clavicle and humerus led to functional gains , which increased the patients ' endurance .	2
At the end of the study , 23 patients ( 82 % ) were able to return to their previous jobs or activity levels .	2
Current preliminary reports suggest that this orthosis can be recommended to prevent significant disability in patients with trapezius palsy due to ablative cancer surgery or other reasons .	2
We previously demonstrated that fenofibrate , a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha ( PPARalpha ) agonist , reduced the neurological deficit , the edema and the cerebral lesion induced by traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) .	0
In order to elucidate these beneficial effects , in the present study , we investigated , in the same TBI model , fenofibrate 's effects on the inflammation and oxidative stress .	1
Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomized in four groups : non-operated , sham-operated , TBI + vehicle , TBI + fenofibrate .	4
TBI was induced by lateral fluid percussion of the temporoparietal cortex .	3
Rats were given fenofibrate ( 50 mg/kg ) or its vehicle ( water containing 0.2 % methylcellulose ) , p.o. 1 and 6 h after brain injury .	3
A neurological assessment was done 24 h after TBI , then rats were killed and the brain COX2 , MMP9 expression , GSx , GSSG levels were determined .	1
The same schedule of treatment was used to evaluate the effect of fenofibrate on immunohistochemistry of 3NT , 4HNE and iNOS at 24 h post-injury .	1
Our results showed that fenofibrate promotes neurological recovery by exerting anti-inflammatory effect evidenced by a decrease in iNOS , COX2 and MMP9 expression .	2
In addition , fenofibrate showed anti-oxidant effect demonstrated by a reduction of markers of oxidative stress : loss of glutathione , glutathione oxidation ratio , 3NT and 4HNE staining .	2
Our data suggest that PPARalpha activation could mediate pleiotropic effects and strengthen that it could be a promising therapeutic strategy for TBI .	2
Claims for personal injury after whiplash injury cost the economy of the United Kingdom more than pound 3 billion per year , yet only very few patients have radiologically demonstrable pathology .	0
Those sustaining fractures of the cervical spine have been subjected to greater force and may reasonably be expected to have worse symptoms than those with whiplash injuries .	0
Using the neck disability index as the outcome measure , we compared pain and functional disability in four groups of patients who had suffered injury to the cervical spine .	0
After a mean follow-up of 3.5 years , patients who had sustained fractures of the cervical spine had significantly lower levels of pain and disability than those who had received whiplash injuries and were pursuing compensation ( p < 0.01 ) , but had simil	2
Functional recovery after neck injury was unrelated to the physical insult .	2
The increased morbidity in whiplash patients is likely to be psychological and is associated with litigation .	2
Previous studies on the treatment of rotator cuff tears in wheelchair-bound patients have concentrated on nonsurgical management .	0
We conducted a retrospective review to determine the effectiveness of surgical repair of rotator cuff tears in spinal cord-injured patients .	4
Five male patients with rotator cuff tears confirmed by physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging underwent rotator cuff repair .	3
Two of eight shoulders were revisions .	1
The patients were evaluated postoperatively with the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Scoring System .	2
These results were compared with preoperative functional assessment .	2
Patients were given a subjective questionnaire to assess their overall experience .	2
Postoperative range of motion improved in 6 of 8 shoulders .	2
Strength was increased in 6 of 8 shoulders .	2
Patients reported satisfaction with the results in 7 of 8 shoulders , and all 5 patients would recommend the procedure to other spinal cord injury patients .	2
At recent follow-up , 7 of 8 shoulders returned to their preinjury level of function .	2
Surgery for spinal cord injury patients with rotator cuff tears can improve their functional capability and autonomy while reducing their pain .	2
Compliance with the demanding postoperative rehabilitation is essential ; therefore proper patient selection is crucial for optimal results .	2
Few data exist about clinical , radiologic findings , clinical outcome , and its predictors in patients with spontaneous vertebral artery dissection ( sVAD ) .	0
Clinical characteristics , imaging findings , 3-month outcomes , and its predictors were investigated in consecutive patients with sVAD .	1
One hundred sixty-nine patients with 195 sVAD were identified .	4
Brain ischemia occurred in 131 patients ( 77 % ; ischemic stroke , n = 114 , 67 % ; transient ischemic attack , n = 17 , 10 % ) .	2
Three patients with ischemic stroke showed also signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) ; 3 ( 2 % ) had SAH without ischemia .	2
The 134 patients with brain ischemia or SAH had head and/or neck pain in 118 ( 88 % ) and pulsatile tinnitus in seven ( 5 % ) patients .	2
The remaining 35 patients ( 21 % ) had isolated head and/or neck pain in 21 ( 12 % ) cases , asymptomatic sVAD in 13 ( 8 % ) , and cervical radiculopathy in one case ( 1 % ) .	2
Location of sVAD was more often in the pars transversaria ( V2 ; 35 % ) or atlas loop ( V3 ; 34 % ) than in the prevertebral ( V1 ; 20 % ) or intracranial ( V4 ; 11 % ) segment ( P = 0.0001 ) .	2
Outcome was favorable ( modified Rankin scale score 0 or 1 ) in 88 ( 82 % ) of 107 ischemic stroke patients with follow up .	2
Two ( 2 % ) patients died .	2
Low baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ( P < 0.0001 ) and younger age ( P = 0.007 ) were independent predictors of favorable outcome .	2
sVAD is predominantly located in the pars transversaria ( V2 ) or the atlas loop ( V3 ) .	2
Most patients show posterior circulation ischemia .	2
Favorable outcome is observed in most ischemic strokes and independently predicted by low National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and younger age .	2
150 unstable injuries of the spine were treated with the CD implant at the University of Louisville -- Level I Trauma Center -- between February 1985 and March 1989 .	4
There were 67 burst fractures , 48 compression fractures and 21 fracture dislocations , 8 flexion distraction fractures and 6 flexion rotation injuries .	1
Ninety-three patients underwent anterior cord decompression and strut grafting followed by posterior CD instrumentation and posterolateral fusion .	3
Fifty-seven patients had posterior CD instrumentation and fusion alone .	1
No neurological deterioration after the procedure was observed , 33 patients improved neurologically .	2
Hospital stay ranged between 7 and 60 days ( mean 20 days ) .	2
114 patients had a minimum follow up of 6 months ( range 6-52 months ) .	2
The mean follow up was 17.7 months .	2
At final follow up 77.8 % of the patients had returned to work and 84.2 % of the patients were almost painfree .	2
The mean loss of correction in the sagittal plane was 6.2 degrees ( range : 0 and 42 degrees ) at final follow up .	2
As technical complications there were four hook cut outs ( 2.6 % ) of which two underwent reosteosynthesis and two did not effect the clinical or radiographic result .	2
The high stability of the device provides a decreased risk of neurological deterioration , a decreased risk of posttraumatic kyphosis and early rehabilitation .	2
Chicks , 8 days of age , were housed in a wind tunnel at temperatures from 12 to 28 C in increments of 4 C.	4
The tunnel was equipped with a microswitch , an infrared bulb located above the switch , and a small electric fan controlled by a rheostat .	3
Following learning , chicks were exposed at each temperature to air speeds of 0 , .5 , 1.0 , and 1.5 m/s according to a Latin-square design .	3
Chicks readily responded to air speed and temperature changes .	2
For each increase of .1 m/s the effective environmental temperature dropped .6 C.	2
Pro-inflammatory cytokines have been shown to be involved in the genesis , persistence , and severity of neuropathic pain following nerve injury .	0
The transcription factor , nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) , plays a pivotal role in regulating pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression .	0
To elucidate the role of NF-kappaB in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain , using a gene-based approach of NF-kappaB decoy , we tested whether the activated NF-kappaB affected pain behavior via the expression of inflammatory mediators .	0
Single endoneurial injections of NF-kappaB decoy , at the site of nerve lesion , significantly alleviated thermal hyperalgesia for up to 2 weeks and suppressed the expression of mRNA of the inflammatory cytokines , iNOS , and adhesion molecules at the site of	3
This finding suggests that a perineural inflammatory cascade , that involves NF-kappaB , is involved in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain .	2
We performed a 3-month , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of 300 mg of gangliosides ( Cronassial ) in 40 outpatients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) .	4
We evaluated drug effect through physical examinations and symptom scales .	1
Though this dosage had no major toxic effect , Cronassial treatment did not significantly benefit ALS patients .	2
We reviewed all pediatric cases referred for emergent/urgent therapy ( requiring treatment within 48 hours ) to identify frequency , patterns of presentation , and efficacy of therapy .	0
We defined five categories of emergent/urgent therapy based on irradiated site and/or signs : Group I , spinal cord compression ; Group II , respiratory compromise ; Group III , infradiaphagmatic distress ; Group IV , intracranial signs ; Group V , pain .	0
From 2/1/88 -3 / 1 / 94 , 104 children with 115 problems were referred by specialists at the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia .	4
Diagnosis , nature of the emergency , and response were examined .	1
Responses were categorized as complete resolution , improvement or stabilization , and progression .	1
The 104 children represented 12 % of referrals during the study period .	2
The most common tumors were CNS PNET and gliomas ( 20 % ) ; and neuroblastoma ( 20 % ) .	2
Forty-five problems occurred with newly diagnosed tumors and 70 after progression .	2
Ninety-one episodes were managed with radiation therapy and 24 with other modalities .	2
Patients with spinal cord/cauda equina ( n = 33 ) compression improved ( 55 % ) or stabilized ( 30 % ) .	2
Patients with respiratory compromise from thoracic ( n = 14 ) or abdominal ( n = 5 ) disease had a response rate of 72 % .	2
Eight patients in group III had a 66 % response .	2
In Group IV ( n = 16 ) , 63 % had complete responses and 19 % had stabilization .	2
Group V ( n = 15 ) patients had a complete or partial response of 93 % .	2
Approximately 10 % of children referred for radiation therapy required emergent/urgent treatment .	2
Eighty percent of patients achieved stabilization or showed improvement in signs and symptoms , indicating that radiotherapy is a valuable and reliable component of multimodal care in such situations .	2
To describe the anaesthetic management and report the incidence of PDPH in three parturients who had experienced accidental dural puncture during labour and the subsequent deliberate intrathecal insertion of an epidural catheter .	0
Inadvertent dural puncture with a 16-gauge Tuohy needle occurred during the first stage of labour at 3-4 cm cervical dilatation in all three women .	4
The 20-gauge epidural catheter was immediately inserted into the subarachnoid space after accidental dural penetration .	3
Intermittent intrathecal injections of lidocaine or bupivacaine with fentanyl were administered to provide analgesia during labour and delivery .	3
Two of the women had spontaneous vaginal deliveries , whereas Caesarean section was performed in one case due to acute fetal distress during the second stage of labour .	2
The intrathecal catheter was left in-situ for 13-19 hr after delivery and the women were questioned daily for symptoms of PDPH .	2
None of the three women developed PDPH after dural puncture and intrathecal catheterisation with the epidural catheter .	2
Immediate intrathecal insertion of the epidural catheter after accidental dural puncture during labour proved to be an effective prophylactic technique to prevent PDPH in these three parturients .	2
An effectively functioning artificial bladder would be useful after cystectomy because of the ease of insertion and the availability to all patients .	0
In this report , we describe a new design concept based on negative pressure drainage of the kidneys and active voiding , and we present the results of testing this device .	0
Although previous prosthetic bladders have had difficulties with renal failure from hydronephrosis , infection from retention of urine , and encrustation of the luminal surface , the current artificial complete bladder system addresses these problems .	0
To date , five single base pair changes of the mitochondrial DNA have been reported to occur either exclusively or with increased frequency in Caucasian patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) and it has been postulated that these mutations might be casuall	0
To evaluate these findings , we analysed the frequency of all five polymorphisms in 100 cases of pathologically proven cases of PD .	4
We were either unable to detect the previously described polymorphisms in our series or found them to be present with the same frequency among controls .	2
Our data do not support the hypothesis of an involvement of the mitochondrial DNA in the pathogenesis of PD .	2
When familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) is diagnosed in a patient , prophylactic surgery must be performed whether colorectal cancer is present or not .	0
Operations for FAP have been performed through a large median abdominal incision or an additional perineal incision , depending on the coexistence of rectal cancer .	0
Recently , we reported a technique of laparoscopic rectal amputation without abdominal skin incision for patients with rectal cancer to minimize postoperative cardiac and respiratory complications [ 6 ] .	4
In this article , we report a case of laparoscopically assisted proctocolectomy with ileostomy through a minimal abdominal and perineal skin incision performed by a hand-assisted procedure .	3
The purpose of combining the perineal and laparoscopic approaches is to minimize the skin incision , while retaining a rate of cure and safety equivalent to those of conventional rectal amputation , by using the advantages of laparoscopic procedures , and to	2
To establish reliability of quantitative measures of elbow joint spastic hypertonia in post-stroke hemiparesis .	0
Nine subjects with post-stroke hemiparesis ( mn duration : 42 months ) were tested on three separate days .	4
Biceps brachii and brachioradialis EMG were recorded during passive ramp-and-hold extensions applied at seven speeds between 30 and 210 degrees / s.	1
EMG burst duration , onset position threshold , and burst intensity were used to evaluate reflex activity .	1
Torque at 40 degrees of elbow flexion was used as a mechanical indicator of spastic hypertonia .	1
Across speeds ICCs were consistent , means ranged between 0.63 and 0.85 .	2
Thus , relative reliability was fair to excellent for all parameters .	2
Absolute reliability , determined using standard error of measurement expressed as a percentage of the mean score ( % SEM ) , improved at higher speeds ( > or = 120 degrees/s ) .	2
These results establish reliability of reflex and mechanical measures of elbow spastic hypertonia post-stroke .	2
The data demonstrate greater reflex detection at high speeds , indicating greater potential to document meaningful changes in these distinct aspects of spastic hypertonia following intervention .	2
Based on findings of this study , reliability was demonstrated using four parameters of reflex EMG and torque indicating measurement consistency across sessions .	2
These observations motivate determination of requisite effect sizes for clinical trials that evaluate treatment outcome .	2
Expression of nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) mRNA in post mortem brain was studied in putamen , globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) of neurologically normal control subjects and patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) using in situ hybridization hist	0
In PD , a significant increase in NOS mRNA expression was observed in the dorsal two-thirds of the STN with respect to the ventral one-third of the STN .	2
A significant increase in NOS mRNA expression per cell in the medial medullary lamina of the globus pallidus was also observed in PD .	2
NOS mRNA expression was significantly reduced in PD putamen .	2
These findings provide evidence of increased activity of STN neurotransmitter systems in PD and demonstrate for the first time in any species that basal ganglia nitric oxide systems can be selectively regulated in response to changes in dopaminergic input	2
The expression of nitric oxide synthase in neurons of the gastrointestinal tract ( GIT ) after experimental spinal cord injury ( SCI ) was assessed in adult rats contused at T8 .	4
One day and 10 weeks after injury , specimens along the GIT were studied for NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry .	1
A significant increase in the number of positive cell bodies and fibers in the myenteric plexus were observed 1 day after SCI , as compared to specimens from control and chronically injured rats , with the exception of the colon , which showed unchanged or d	2
Positive neurons in the submucous plexus remained unchanged , excepting an increase in the colon after acute SCI , and a decrease in the duodenum in chronically injured rats .	2
The altered nitric oxide neurotransmission in the GIT may be relevant to its reduced motility after SCI .	2
The impact of HIV/AIDS is different in developed and developing countries including India .	0
Limited access to health care facilities , lack of infrastructure for diagnostic set up and cost of anti retroviral therapy are some of the reasons .	0
Early accurate diagnosis of opportunistic infections ( OIs ) , the common presenting symptom of the patients , is the key for success of effective management .	0
This review attempts an overview of few of the important OIs with which majority of Indian patients present in the clinics .	4
Emphasis has been on conventional method of diagnostic approach , which is possible in most of the diagnostic laboratory set up in India .	0
Awareness of the disease and maintenance of high index of clinical suspicion are required .	0
An integrated approach to patient management with active interaction between clinicians and microbiologists would be highly beneficial .	0
Introduction of routine in vitro antimicrobial testing system especially for Candida sp , Cryptococcus sp and Mycobacterium sp , is also important , in order to obtain a baseline data on the susceptibility pattern , which not only have therapeutic relevance ,	0
Administrative support for the skill development of personnel , facility for data preservation and telemedicine can extend the diagnostic expertise to the remote areas , without affecting the patients mobility .	2
A 26-year-old subfertile woman with a history of abortions at the 7-9th week was treated with Clomid , 50 mg for 5 days .	4
A pregnancy resulted , which ended in the premature birth of a set of alive triplets that sex and blood-group determinations showed to be trizgotic .	2
It is suggested that this production of a multiple ovulation in a woman with luteal deficiency be the result of excessive dosage of Clomid .	2
Unexplained infertility is a diagnosis made by exclusion after all of the standard investigations have revealed no abnormality ( 1 ) .	0
The range of the prevalence is from 6 to 60 percent ( 23 ) , depending on the diagnostic criteria .	0
This article reviews the literature in the management of unexplained infertility ; published data suggest no benefit of danazol or bromocriptine .	0
The empirical use of clomiphene citrate suggests that ovarian stimulation using clomiphene citrate can double the spontaneous pregnancy rate ( 52 , 58 , 59 ) .	2
Induction of ovulation with human menopausal gonadotrophin ( hMG ) yields an overall pregnancy rate between 2 and 26 percent per cycle ( 68 , 74 ) .	2
These results seem to be lower than those reported for in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) or gamete intrafallopian transfer ( GIFT ) procedures in similar patients ( 25-30 percent ( 92 , 95 ) ) .	2
Based on the literature , a rational treatment plan for treating infertility in couples with unexplained infertility includes up to four cycles of clomiphene citrate with or without intrauterine insemination ( IUI ) .	2
Superovulation with hMG and IUI or stimulated intrauterine insemination ( SIUI ) is the next step for three-cycle treatments and if unsuccessful , one of the variants of assisted reproductive techniques ( ART ) should be considered .	2
Nitric oxide ( NO ) has been implicated in immune mediated cellular cytotoxicity and inflammatory processes including multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .	0
We aimed to assess NO production in MS patients and to delineate its involvement in different stages .	1
The stable end-products of NO ; nitrite ( NO2 - ) and nitrate ( NO3 - ) were analysed both in serum and CSF ( cerebrospinal fluid ) of patients with MS and non-inflammatory neurological diseases .	4
Nitrite levels were quantified by calorimetric assay based on the Griess reaction .	1
Nitrate levels were examined spectrophotometrically .	1
MS patients exhibited significantly increased serum and CSF levels of NO2 - + NO3 - compared with the control subjects .	2
CSF NO2 - + NO3 - levels were raised significantly in MS patients with both relapsing remitting ( RR ) and secondary progressive ( SP ) course .	2
There was no significant difference between RR and SP MS patients with regard to NO metabolites .	2
No significant correlation was found between NO metabolites and disability score , disease progression index , MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) activity and development of cortical atrophy on MRI .	2
This study provides further evidence for excessive NO production both in CSF and peripheral blood of MS patients .	2
Excessive CSF NO2 - + NO3 - levels being more increased than the levels in sera supports pathological inflammatory process within CNS ( central nervous system ) in both stages of MS.	2
Another implication for the role of NO and INOS inhibitors in the treatment of MS patients with both RR and SP courses was also suggested .	2
Changes in amplitude of the soleus H ( S ( H ) ) - reflex and its neurographic correlates ( P ( 1 ) and P ( 2 ) waves ) after vibration of the soleus muscle have been evaluated as a function of mechanical stimulation frequency , duration of the conditioning train , and te	0
Additional experiments aimed at assessing the nervous system mechanisms underlying the postvibration depression ( PVD ) have been performed .	0
In particular , homonymous ( S ( HMR ) or S ( H ) ) versus heteronymous ( S ( HTR ) ) soleus response , evoked respectively by tibial nerve and femoral nerve electrical stimulation , the effectiveness of sub-H threshold tibial nerve conditioning volleys on the S ( HTR ) , an	3
It was found that PVD occurs in the absence of changes in amplitude of the P ( 1 ) wave and the S ( HTR ) , is paralleled by a reduced effectiveness of tibial nerve-conditioning volleys on the S ( HTR ) and is shortened consistently by brief passive stretching of t	2
It follows that PVD may be the result of a long-lasting reduction of the transmitter release from Ia presynaptic terminals depending , at least in part , on a protracted postvibration Ia afferent discharge caused by spindles thixotropy .	2
These findings may provide a better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying spasticity in humans .	2
Persistent neck symptoms following flexion-extension type injuries are common and may respond to early mobilization .	0
Cervical degenerative disc and joint disease probably account for most chronic neck-related problems .	0
Most often symptoms result from compression of neural structures , especially nerve roots .	0
The cervical spine is commonly affected by rheumatoid arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis , and other inflammatory arthropathies .	0
Potentially serious complications usually result from subluxations at C1-C2 , usually in chronic rheumatoid arthritis .	0
Most problems causing neck pain without neurologic signs or symptoms can be managed conservatively with physical therapy maneuvers , especially interrupted traction .	2
This is a review of the impact of spinal cord injury on female sexuality , which has received far less attention than male sexuality , and on menstruation , contraception and pregnancy , which have been reported more extensively .	0
The few reports of sexuality in women after spinal cord injury suggests a wide range of adaptability , from 40 % to 88 % of the subjects achieving satisfactory sexual activity .	2
Some women were able to adapt a positive body image and find new ways of stimulation to orgasm , despite altered body shape , bladder and bowel incontinence , spasticity , and lack of sensation often resulting from spinal injury .	2
The pill , vaginal methods , and IUDs are not recommended , but condoms and possibly Norplant , are appropriate for these women .	2
Menstruation , often ceasing for several months after injury , usually resumes .	2
One study reported lack of menstrual pain , others did not .	2
Many spinal injuries women have achieved 1 or more pregnancies .	2
A few cases have been described of successful pregnancy when the injury occurred during gestation , as has 1 intrauterine death that was successfully delivered by induction .	2
Premature cervical dilatation and labor and small-for-dates infants are more common than usual , but spontaneous abortion are not .	2
Some of the typical problems in pregnancy are urinary tract infections , decubiti , anemia , pedal edema , weight transfer problems , thrombophlebitis , TIA episodes , and nausea .	2
A more serious problem is management of labor , especially if the woman can not perceive labor pains , or can not bear down .	2
Frequent check-ups and early hospitalization are recommended .	2
A potentially fatal risk in those injured at T6 or above , is autonomic dysreflexia , stimulated by induction , labor , delivery , or even breast feeding .	2
Autonomic dysreflexia can be treated with epidural anesthesia with lidocaine .	2
Induction is contraindicated .	2
Lactation may cease after 3 months or so because of lack of nipple stimulation .	2
To evaluate the reliability and validity of a self-report FIM ( FIM-SR ) in two samples of adults with disabilities .	0
Participants in a clinical trial of amitriptyline for pain ( n = 84 with spinal cord injury [ SCI ] , n = 38 with amputation ) provided responses to the study measures via telephone interview .	1
Reliability was estimated using Cronbach 's alpha and test-retest correlation coefficients , and validity was examined by comparing FIM-SR scores with the Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique ( CHART ) by comparing the CHART scores between the participants with SCI and amputation , and by comparing CHART scores between subjects with different levels of SCI .	1
In the SCI sample , the FIM-SR demonstrated adequate reliability , and correlational analyses supported the validity of the FIM-SR motor scales .	2
In addition , the FIM-SR motor scales discriminated subjects with different diagnoses ( SCI vs. amputation ) and injury levels ( paraplegia vs. tetraplegia ) .	2
The psychometric properties of the entire FIM-SR in the amputation sample and of the FIM-SR cognitive scales in the SCI sample were difficult to determine due to a ceiling effect in which these scale scores were skewed toward the top end of the range .	2
The FIM-SR motor scales and total FIM-SR score are reliable and valid measures of perceived functional independence in individuals with SCI .	2
However , all of the FIM-SR scales in the amputation sample , and the FIM-SR cognitive scales in the SCI sample , seem to be less useful measures of functioning due to subjects reporting high levels of independence .	2
The FIM-SR should be retested in amputation samples with more variable levels of functioning .	2
The reasons for a different incidence of osteoporotic fractures in white and black women are unknown .	0
Previous racial comparisons of bone mass have been limited by racial differences in body weight and socioeconomic , health , and nutritional status .	0
This cross-sectional study examined bone density in 105 black and 114 white healthy nonobese women , 24-65 yr old , using dual photon absorptiometry of the lumbar spine and single photon absorptiometry of the distal radius .	4
Bone density at both sites was higher in blacks at all ages than in whites .	2
When adjusted for age and body mass index , mean bone density was 6.5 % higher in blacks at both spine and radius ( P less than 0.0001 ) .	2
The cross-sectional rate of decline of vertebral bone density was similar between races ; however , radial density increased 3.8 % / decade ( P = 0.03 ) in premenopausal blacks under age 46 yr , while it declined 3.2 % / decade ( P = 0.09 ) in premenopausal whites .	2
The racial difference in slopes in these premenopausal women is significant ( P = 0.002 ) .	2
These findings suggest that attainment of higher peak bone mass and delayed onset of bone loss contribute to the lower incidence of osteoporotic fractures in black women .	2
Pancreatic carcinoma is the fourth cause of death for cancer in the USA , carrying a dismal prognosis and poor overall survival .	0
Unfortunately , resection for cure is feasible in a limited number of patients , thus confirming the need for an early diagnosis and accurate preoperative staging to select patients potentially resectable from those candidates to palliative treatment .	0
Among imaging modalities , endoscopic procedures ( endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , laparoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography ) play a key role in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic tumors .	0
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) allows direct visualization of the main pancreatic duct and its side branches with their morphologic alterations , which are present in most cases of pancreatic cancer .	0
The method is very sensitive in experienced hands , with diagnostic accuracy over 95 % .	0
The most common finding in pancreatic cancer is the stricture of the pancreatic duct , the bile duct , or both .	0
Moreover , ductal brush cytology and K-ras mutation analysis can be performed during ERCP , possibly improving the diagnostic accuracy of the technique .	0
Diagnostic laparoscopy provides detection of small ( < 1 cm ) liver metastases and peritoneal implants of tumor which can not be visualized by any other imaging modality , with the possibility to biopsy under direct vision suspicious areas or to perform pe	0
The adjunct of laparoscopic ultrasound improves the staging capabilities of the technique for pancreatic cancer ( retroperitoneal spread , vascular invasion ) .	0
Endoscopic ultrasonography ( EUS ) is able to produce great detail of the pancreatic parenchyma and regional lymph nodes .	0
It is especially sensitive in the detection of small pancreatic masses which can not be imaged with other modalities .	0
EUS has the additional advantage of directing transduodenal fine-needle aspiration biopsies .	0
Presently it is the most sensitive technique for the diagnosis and locoregional staging of pancreatic cancer , but limits have been identified in the lack of specificity ( differentiation between malignant tumor and focal pancreatitis ) and its operator-depe	0
Reported is our experience with EUS in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer .	1
Over a seven-year period 43 patients with pancreatic tumors were staged with EUS preoperatively .	3
Twenty-two patients were submitted to surgery at our Institution and EUS findings were compared with results of pathology or surgical exploration .	1
EUS provided sensitivity of 100 % for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer , while its accuracy for staging tumor infiltration , lymph node involvement and vascular invasion was 86.4 % , 69.2 % and 77.8 % , respectively .	2
Despite improvements in the noninvasive imaging modalities , endoscopic techniques are likely to remain established methods for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer .	2
EUS with fine-needle aspiration biopsy is probably the most promising , followed by laparoscopy ( and laparoscopic ultrasound ) which is essential to rule out small peritoneal implants and liver metastasis .	2
The objective of this study was to examine alteration in head repositioning accuracy ( HRA ) , range of motion , and pain intensity in patients with chronic cervical pain syndrome without a history of cervical trauma .	0
Forty-one patients with chronic cervical pain were randomly assigned to either a control group or a chiropractic treatment group .	4
All patients were clinically examined , given general information on cervical pain , and provided with training instructions based on the clinical evaluation .	1
The treatment included sessions with high-velocity and low-amplitude manipulation , proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation , ischemic compression of myofascial trigger points , and spinal rehabilitation exercises aiming to normalize cervical range of moti	3
Subjective pain intensity , cervical kinesthetic sensibility , and CROM were recorded before and after the study period .	1
There was no difference between the treatment patients and the control subjects at the beginning with regard to age , sex , subjective pain intensity , range of motion , and HRA .	2
At the 5-week follow-up , the treatment patients showed significant reductions in pain and improvement of all HRA aspects measured whereas the control subjects did not show any reduction in pain and improvement in only one HRA aspect .	2
No significant difference was detected in CROM .	2
The results of this study suggest that chiropractic care can be effective in influencing the complex process of proprioceptive sensibility and pain of cervical origin .	2
Short , specific chiropractic treatment programs with proper patient information may alter the course of chronic cervical pain .	2
To determine the predictive value of the rate of change of serial beta-human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) values in patients with symptoms suggestive of ectopic pregnancy but who have indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound findings , and to determine whethe	0
A retrospective study was performed on consecutive emergency department patients from August 1 , 1991 , through August 1 , 1998 , presenting with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding , a positive beta-hCG test result , and indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound fi	4
Patients were eligible for the study if they had a second beta-hCG assay performed within 7 days of the initial visit and before either a diagnostic dilation and evacuation or laparoscopy .	1
Patients were excluded if they were lost to follow-up .	1
Patients were divided into 4 groups based on the rate of change of beta-hCG values over a 48-hour interval ( increase by > 66 % , increase by < 66 % , decrease by < 50 % , decrease by > 50 % ) .	1
In addition , the 4 main groups were further subdivided depending on whether the endometrial cavity was empty at ultrasound examination .	1
Intergroup differences in the frequency of ectopic pregnancy based on the rate of change of the beta-hCG value were compared using logistic regression .	1
Logistic regression also was used to determine whether addition of the ultrasound result improved predicative accuracy .	1
A P value of less than .05 was considered significant .	1
Odds ratios ( ORs ) were determined for each subgroup .	1
Three hundred thirty-one eligible patients were identified ; of these , 24 were excluded .	2
Of the 307 enrolled patients , 33 ( 10.7 % ) had a final diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy .	2
Intergroup differences in the frequency of ectopic pregnancy based on the beta-hCG rate of change were significant ( P < .0001 ) .	2
Addition of the ultrasound result to this model further improved predicative accuracy ( P < .0001 ) .	2
Overall , patients with increasing beta-hCG values were at increased risk compared with those with decreasing beta-hCG values , and patients with empty uteri at ultrasound were at increased risk compared with those with uteri that were not empty .	2
Combining the beta-hCG rate of change with the ultrasound result identified 3 high-risk groups : patients with beta-hCG values that increased by less than 66 % and an empty uterus at ultrasound ( OR 24.8 ) ; patients with beta-hCG values that decreased by less	2
Patients with beta-hCG values that decreased by more than 50 % were found to be at low risk for ectopic pregnancy irrespective of the specific endometrial findings at ultrasound .	2
The rate of change of serial beta-hCG values , in patients with an indeterminate pelvic ultrasound examination , is predictive of ectopic pregnancy .	2
Addition of whether the endometrial cavity is empty at ultrasound leads to a further improvement in predictive accuracy .	2
Family-centred care ( FCC ) is a widely used model in paediatrics , and is felt instinctively to be the best way to provide care to children in hospital .	0
However , its effectiveness has not been measured .	0
The primary objective of this review was to assess the effects of family-centred models of care for hospitalised children when compared to standard or professionally-centred models of care , on child , family and health service outcomes .	0
We searched MEDLINE ( 1966 to February 2004 ) ; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , ( The Cochrane Library , Issue 2 , 2004 ) ; CINAHL ( 1982 to February 2004 ) ; PsycINFO ( 1972 to February 2004 ) ; ERIC ( 1982 to February 2004 ) ; Sociological Abstracts ( 1963 to February 2004 ) ; Social Work Abstracts ( 1977 to February 2004 ) ; and AMI ( Australasian Medical Index ) ( 1966 to February 2004 ) .	1
We searched for randomised controlled trials ( RCTs ) or quasi-randomised controlled trials including cluster randomised trials and controlled clinical trials ( CCTs ) , and controlled before and after studies ( CBAs ) , in which family-centred care models are compared with professionally-centred models of care for hospitalised children ( aged up to 12 years ) .	1
Studies also had to meet criteria for family-centredness and methodological quality .	1
In order to assess studies for the degree of family-centredness , this review utilised a modified rating scale based on a validated instrument .	1
Two review authors undertook the searches , and three authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data .	1
We contacted study authors for additional information .	1
No studies met inclusion criteria , and hence no analysis could be undertaken .	2
Five studies came close to inclusion .	2
Three of these studies were excluded primarily because of inadequate or unclear blinding of outcome assessment , while for one study the age group was outside the parameters of this review .	2
One study met most criteria , but the children were aged up to 18 years .	2
We contacted the study authors who kindly provided a subset analysis , but on further examination the study also proved to have inadequate blinding procedures and so was not included .	2
It was not possible to undertake any subset analysis of populations .	2
Of the other studies identified through the search , 13 met some of the inclusion criteria but were reports of qualitative research and are reviewed elsewhere .	2
This review has highlighted the dearth of high quality quantitative research about family-centred care .	2
A much more stringent examination of the use of family-centred care as a model for care delivery to children and families in health services is needed .	2
To compare muscle strength and muscle fatigue of the knee extensors and flexors in individuals with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) and non-MS control subjects and to evaluate the reliability of muscle strength and muscle fatigue testing in these individuals .	0
Thirty individuals ( 13 women and 2 men for both MS and control groups ) , age ( mean + / - SD ) 38.8 + / - 10 for MS and 33.1 + / - 7.6 yr for controls , participated in this investigation .	4
Peak torque was measured on two occasions separated by approximately 7 d at 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 degrees.s ( -1 ) with 2 min of recovery between each bout .	3
The nondominant leg was tested followed by the dominant leg after 10 min of recovery .	3
Subjects then performed three bouts of 30 flexions and extensions of the dominant leg at 180 degrees.s ( -1 ) with 1 min of recovery between bouts .	3
The reliability of muscle torque was very high for individuals with MS ( only 1 of 20 measurements with an ICC below 0.900 ) .	2
Total work was also highly reliable for MS , but the Fatigue Index ( work during the last 15 contractions/work during the first 15 contractions ) x 100 was not .	2
Peak torque adjusted for age , body mass , and fat free mass ( measured by whole body plethysmography ; the Bod Pod ; Life Measurement Instruments ; Concord , CA ) was significantly greater for controls than for MS for three of four lower body muscle groups teste	2
For the muscle fatigue test ( 3 bouts of 30 knee extensions and flexions at 180 degrees.s ( -1 ) ) , the Fatigue Index was greater ( less fatigue ) for the knee extensors for controls than MS for the third bout .	2
For flexion , the Fatigue Index was greater for controls than MS over the three bouts ( group effect ) .	2
Total work was significantly greater for controls than MS for the flexors ( group effect ) and approached significance for the extensors .	2
Individuals with MS were weaker than controls when data were adjusted for age , body mass , and fat free mass .	2
This latter finding ( force relative to age and fat free mass ) suggests that there is a reduced ability to activate muscle mass in MS and/or the muscle mass of individuals with MS is of lower quality ( i.e. , reduced force/unit muscle mass ) than controls .	2
